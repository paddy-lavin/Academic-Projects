## Projects

### 🏀 Modeling Spatial Expected Points Allowed by NBA Defenses
**Files:** `479proj1_finalprez_rjs.qmd` · `Modeling Spatial Expected Points Allowed by NBA Defenses.pdf`

A spatial modeling project analyzing NBA defensive performance by estimating expected points allowed based on shot location and defensive positioning. The findings were presented to the UW-Madison Athletic, Statistics, and Mathematics departments as a part of the UW-Madison Sports Buisness Conference. The `.qmd` file contains the full analysis code, and the `.pdf` is the slide deck from the presentation.

### 🎵 Feature Analysis in Music: Predicting Song Popularity
**File:** `451_Final_Report.pdf`

This project investigates what makes a song popular using a full machine learning workflow. Two central questions guided the analysis:
1. What factors play into how popular a song becomes?
2. Which audio or genre-related features are most predictive of a hit?

The pipeline included data cleaning, feature scaling, exploratory analysis, and both regression and classification modeling — with a focus on whether long-term historical patterns within genres and subgenres offer stronger predictive power than individual audio features alone.

### 🏈 Quantifying Defensive Impact on Pass Outcomes Using NFL Tracking Data
**File:** `Project3_final_draft.pdf`

Using NFL Big Data Bowl player-tracking data, this project models catch probability frame-by-frame to measure how defensive coverage changes the likelihood of a completion in real time. Traditional metrics like interceptions or completion percentage allowed only capture final outcomes — this approach introduces **CP_DROP** (change in catch probability from ball release to arrival) as a continuous metric that accounts for separation, leverage, route type, and ball trajectory. The result is a richer tool for evaluating individual defenders and defensive schemes.

### 🌺 Comparison of Birth Rates in Hawaii (1900–2011)
**File:** `Stat 240 Final Project (1).Rmd`

An exploratory statistical analysis of birth rate trends in Hawaii over the past century using data collected by the Hawaii Department of Health (sourced from data.gov). The project examines how birth rates per 1,000 people shifted from the early 1900s to the early 2000s, accounting for potential outliers caused by health crises or policy changes. Findings suggest a slight overall increase in birth rates across the period studied.
